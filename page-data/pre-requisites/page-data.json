See the following [installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git). \n\nOn a Centos box we did:\n\n```\nyum install git\n```\n\n## Clone all the repositories\n\nStart by cloning the root repository using the command:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc/\n```\n\nThen go to the `refarch-kc` folder and use the command:\n\n```\n./script/clone.sh\n``` \n\nto get all the solution repositories. You should have at least the following repositories:\n\n```\nrefarch-kc-container-ms\nrefarch-kc-order-ms\nrefarch-kc-ui\nrefarch-kc\nrefarch-kc-ms\nrefarch-kc-streams\n```\n\n\n## Get docker\n\nGet [docker engine and install](https://docs.docker.com/install/) it (if not yet done). To verify docker runs fine use the command `docker version`. We run on v19.03 community edition.\n\nor use one of the packaged solution like on Centos:\n\n```\nyum install docker\n```\n\n## Verifying current environment\n\nTo assess the tools installed on your computer, run the following command under the `refarch-kc` project:\n\n```\n./scripts/prepareEnv\n```\n\nThe script will create the docker images for maven, nodejs, and python if those tools are not found on your computer. The images are built from our docker files you can find under the `refarch-kc/dockers` folder.\n\n```\ndocker images\n```\n\n```\nREPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\nibmcase/python      latest              8d38aefd0346        2 minutes ago       1.14 GB\nibmcase/nodetools   latest              7a736a07ba09        2 minutes ago       959 MB\nibmcase/javatools   latest              bdf79f64d721        23 minutes ago      715 MB\n\n```\n\nYou to have two choices to build the solution: \n\n1. installing node, python and maven on your computer\n1. use our own docker images for running those tools\n\nYou can mix the two. If, for example, you already developed with Nodejs or Java you may want to leverage your own configurations. If you do not want to impact your python environment, you can user our docker images. \n\nTo be able to build without our docker images do the following:\n\n## Get Java\n\nDo something like this:\n\n```\nyum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel\n```\n\n## Get Maven\n\nget [maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) and add it to your PATH.\n\nor for a Centos linux:\n\n```\nyum install maven\n```\n\n## Get nodejs\n\nGet [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n\nor for a Centos linux:\n\n```\nyum install node\n```\n\n\n## Get Python 3.7\n\nOur integration tests are done in python. To avoid impacting your own python environment, we defined a docker file to build an image with the necessary python library. The image may have been already built with the `preparenv` script run in previous step.\n\nIf you want to rebuild it, go to the `docker` folder and run the following command: \n```\ndocker build -f docker-python-tools -t ibmcase/python .\n```\n\n## Global environment settings\n\nIn the `refarch-kc` rename `./script/setenv.sh.tmpl` to `./script/setenv.sh`:\n\n```\nmv setenv.sh.tmpl setenv.sh\n```\n\nThen modify the environment variables according to your environment you are using. This file is used by a lot of scripts in the solution to set the target deployment environment: LOCAL, IBMCLOUD, ICP, MINIKUBE.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"7621a574b44196a5e6fcf78d059058f2","counter":258,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pre-requisites","description":"Pre-requisites"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Pre-requisites\ndescription: Pre-requisites\n---\n\n\nTo be able to build and execute the solution, you need to do the following tasks:\n\n## Get a Git client\n\nIf not already done, get a git client.
