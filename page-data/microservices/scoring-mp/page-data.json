These telemetry events will be read and used to contact a container anomaly prediction service based on Watson Machine Learning hosted on the IBM Cloud. Depending on whether the prediction service predicts a container anomaly, this Telemetry microservice will send a [Container Anomaly Event](#container-anomaly-event) to the [Containers Topic](#containers-topic) for the [Containers microservice](#containers) to handle the shipping goods spoilage.\n\nThis microservice has been implemented using the latest [Reactive Messaging](#reactive-messaging) feature of MicroProfile 3.0. running on the OpenLiberty server.\n\n![Telemetry diagram](images/microservice-overview-scoring-mp.png)\n\n**Further details:** [Microservices Details > Anomalous Container Scoring](/microservices/scoring-mp)\n\n**Github repository:** [refarch-reefer-ml](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml)\n\n**Folder:** [scoring-mp](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml/tree/master/scoring-mp)\n\n**Kafka topics consumed from:**\n\n- [Reefer Telemetry Topic](#reefer-telemetry-topic)\n\n**Kafka topics produced to:**\n\n- [Containers Topic](#containers-topic)\n\n**Events reacted to:**\n\n- [Container Telemetry Event](#container-telemetry-event)\n\n**Events produced:**\n\n- [Container Anomaly Event](#container-anomaly-event)\n\n**EDA Patterns implemented:**\n\n- [Reactive Messaging](#reactive-messaging)\n\n## Build\n\nTBD\n\n## Run\n\nTBD\n\n## Integration Tests\n\nTBD\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nTBD To be sourced from https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml/tree/master/scoring-mp\n\nReactive Systems provide an architecture style to deliver responsive systems.
