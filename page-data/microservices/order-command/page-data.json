We want to be able to successfully process all of them regardless of how many actions these entail, making sure these actions are all executed and we get confirmation of those. We want to process these actions in a transaction-like manner so that a request is not successfully marked as processed unless all actions were successfully executed.\n\nThe key of this loop is that the produced event to the Orders Topic as the last action of the request (so that all previous actions have successfully been executed already) will be produced along with the offset commitment for the command read as a transaction.
